DNS in Linux

      If you want to Ping another Host from current one then you can do by IP. However if you want to do with hostname that you have to edit the etc/hosts files and add the ip with hostname. here below is the syntax
      192.1.12.1    db
      you can add multiple hostname with one ip address
      192.1.12.1    www.google.com
      
      Every host has DNS resolution configuration file at /etc/resolv.conf
      in this file we say 
      nameserver      192.1.12.100
      nameserver      8.8.8.8       (its for externel website that are not in our internel DNS)
      
      
      search     mycompany.com      (if you want to search web.mycompany.com than by doing this you can only do ping web. ) 
      search     mycompany.com      prod.mycompany.com     (we can add multiple domains. )
      
      If you have Hostname resolve in file(/etc/hosts) and DNS server. then firslty it processed with file and then DNS server.
      We can change this by editing /etc/nsswtich.conf file



Record Types:

    translate domain to IPV4   = A 
    Translate domain to IPV6   = AAAA
    translate domain to domain = CNAME


Ping not may be the right tools always for DNS resolution
    there are another tools like nslookup. but didn't consider entries in /etc/hosts file
    nslookup  www.google.com


another tool is DIG. it return in more details.
  dig www.google.com



Switching and Routing



Gateway
if you want to sent a packet from one network to anther then we have to specify(specify both in switches) the gateway and ip address route.
ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.1

you can check all route by command route 


ip addr add 192.2.2.2/24 dev eth0 (used to add interface device)
