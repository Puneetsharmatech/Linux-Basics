Linux Security

Linux Security is very vast topic in linux that involves many topics:
    Access Control: this method make use of user and password based authentication to determine who can access the system.
    PAM(Pluggable Authentication Module): It is another way of managing authentication in linux. It is noramlly used to authenticate users to program and services in linux.
    Network Security: it is used to restrict or allow access listening to services on linux server .
    SSH Hardening:  SSH stands for secure shell. it make sure only authenticate person can get access of linux server.
    SELinux:  it is using of secure policies for isolating applications running on the same system from each other 


Linux Accounts:
             all user list we can see in /etc/passwd file. with all Uid(User id) which is unique for every user and with defalut shell and home directory. same information about group is stored in /etc/group   
            
            User Account: an individual account for its use.
            Super user account : root user who have all the access. for this UID is 0
            System account: system account are created during OS installation. these use by software and services that not use by root user  UID account are oftenly lies under 100 or 500 to 1000.
            Service account: Service account are same as system account. its installed when services are install in linux. e:g nginx server, mysql.
            
            To see who is logged in command is who
            To see recent logged in user command is last
            To change the user command is su -
            
            To change the sudo configutation the file is /etc/sudoers 
            
            the password of user are store in hash method in /etc/shadow
            
            all group name stored in /etc/group
            
            To add User, command is adduser <username>
            To set a password for username, command is passwd <username>
            
            To remove User, command is userdel <username>



File permission and Ownerships

            in linux, octal value of read(r) is 4, write(w) is 2 and execute(x) is 1. if the permission is 0, it means no permission.
            when we see details of file, it look like   -rwxrwxr-x. it mean first three rwx permision to owner, next three to group and last three permission to other.
            Command needs to modify the permission is chmod.
            chmod 766 <filename>   
            above syntax is numeric way to change the permission
            
            now its symbolic method
            
            chmod u+rwx <filename>       this command mean give all access to users.
            chmod ugo+rwx <filename>      this command mean give all permission to users group and others
            chmod o_rwx <filename>        this command mean remove all access to others .
            chmod u+rwx, g+r-x,o-rwx <test-file>     Full access for Owner, add read, remove execute for group and no access for others.

Changing ownership of file

command is chown
chown bob:developer <test-file>        Changes owner to bob and group to developer
chown bob andoid. apk          Changes just the owner of the file to bob. Group unchanged.
chgrp android test-file        Change the group for the test-file to the group called android.
