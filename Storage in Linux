Block devices: 
      block devices is a type of file that can be found n /dev  directory. Traditional and SSD are the example of block devices. it is called because data read and written in blocks.
      to see the list of block devices the command is lsblk 
      in the output of lsblk, we can see sda. this is a entire disk. and sda1, sda2 ,sda3 are disk partions.  each block have major and minor number. major number is used to identify the type of block device.
      to print partition table, command is Fdisk-L   
      
      
      Partition types:
      Primary : it is used to boot an OS. we can only create 4 primary partitions.
      Extended: : it is used to create a logical partition
      Logical: it is created in extended partition to extend the logical partition.
      
      maximum size of disk is 2TB
      
      
      To create partion the command is gdisk /dev/<diskname>
    after that enter n key. 


Linux File Systems
    we have two types of file system EXT2, EXT3 and EXT4 
    lets do quick comparison
EXT2:
    2 TB file size
    4 TB volume size 
    support linux permissions
    long crash recovery
    support compression

EXT3:
    2TB file size
    4TB volume size
    uses journal
    Backwards Compatible

EXT4:
    16TB file size
    1Exabyte volume size
    uses journals
    uses chksum for journal
    Backward compatible



To create a file system:
      command is mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1
      
      after that 
      mkdir /mnt/ext4;
      mount  /dev/sdb1 /mnt/ext4
      
      To check command is df

To make this mount availabe after the reboot edit /etc/fstab file.
