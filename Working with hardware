Working with Hardware Commands
Dmesg                        - its a command used to display messages from an area of the kernel called ring buffer. when a linux kernel bootsup, there are numerous messages generated by the kernel that appears on the display screen.
udevadm  info  --query=path --name=/dev/sda5                      -
                                  udevadm: This is a command-line utility for interacting with the Linux device manager, udev. Udev is responsible for creating and managing device nodes in the /dev directory.
                                  info: This option tells udevadm to retrieve information about a device.
                                  --query=path: Specifies that you want to query the internal system path of the device.
                                  --name=/dev/sda5: Indicates the device node you want to get information about. In this case, /dev/sda5 is likely the fifth partition on the first SATA drive.
udevadm monitor              - listen to the kernel u events and detect and print them
lspci                        - list PCI (peripheral component interconnect)e:g of PCI are ethernet, raid controller, video cards.
lsblk                        - list information about the block storage.
lscpu                        - to display information of CPU architecture
lsmem --summary              - list to available memory in the system
free -m                      -  This command show total vs used memory in the system. -m for result in MB. -K for in KB and -G for GB
lshw                         -  To extract detailed information on the entire hardware configuration of the machine.
